# Contest Web App built Using Firebase, Vue.js, Boostrap

> This project is a Web App for people to use as a baby birthdate pool tracker. 

### About:
Often when someone is expecting a baby, friends, coworkers, family members, etc., have fun making guesses about when the baby will be born and other details. This can be done in the form of a pool, often with prizes involved.

I thought it would be fun and helpful to make an app available online for people to be able to keep track of everyone's guesses in real time.

This is a Captstone project for the course WATS 4030 of the Web Development Certificate at Seattle University. The app was built using Vue.js with Firebase to allow for data to be entered and stored and updated in real time. It also makes use of the VueFire library, Toastr, Bootstrap 4 for styling, and Vue Analaytics.
