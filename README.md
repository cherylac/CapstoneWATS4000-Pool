# Contest Web App built Using Firebase, Vue.js, Boostrap

> This project is a Web App for people to use as a baby birthdate pool tracker. 

### About:
This is a Captstone project for the course WATS 4030 of the Web Development Certificate at Seattle University. 

I thought it would be fun to create an app that helps people keep track of a birthdate pool. This involved needing a way to store and update data, so the app makes use of the Firebase database and API to do this. I used Vue.js to build the app, it also makes use of the VueFire library, Toastr, Bootstrap 4 for styling, FontAwesome and Vue Analaytics.

I used Visual Studio Code and GitBash in my local environment and deployed the project on GitHub.
